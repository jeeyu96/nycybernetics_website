              We share our results with you after a specified time frame. These
              are discussed and validated together. In the first phase, we
              define the problem and set a goal. All requirements are summarized
              in a specifications document. In the solution phase, we present
              several variants to you and discuss them in detail with you. After
              the joint discussion, the elaboration of the details and the
              finalization of the project begins. In general, clearly define the
              problem (definition), set the specifications, consider solutions,
              present the solutions and then discuss the details. I wouldn t say
              too much about our current projects, due to data protection and
              such.
